# Angtutstoreapp

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.1.2.

This code is a better and more functional version of Angular first tutorial on official A site.
This version includes better css make with scss, few tweeks in typescript and better routing with back tracking options. 

--- IMPORTANT NOTICE ---
On the product site where all of them are listed, click on anything besides visible buttons to go to the product site to "make a purchase". There was a reason in tut to include product view so I decided to keep the functionality and just go to the product page via clicking anything. 
Later on, quite some time was already used for this project and I tried to deploy project as soon as possible and this function passed unnoticed. It's not a problem IMO but may be a little bit unclear what to do in the app, but it's a very simple app.
